              <h1>The IRS: A Crappy Boss</h1>
		<h2>My Affordable Care Act Employer Reporting Experience - 2015</h2>
            </div>

		<p>Ok, you can’t avoid it, you got a new Boss. You can’t do anything about it (you knew it was going to happen), you just have to grin and bear it. Boss has a reputation for being difficult. He has strong conviction in his ever-changing preferences but he fails to fully explain them fully: leaving the employees he manages in a hopeless state of constantly trying to please him and never succeeding. He only has a couple of close acquaintances at work that understand him and put up with his crap to avoid being punished too severely.</p>
		<p>The United States Internal Revenue Service was my Boss for 2015 and still is in 2016. He invited himself into my Human Resource department and made himself comfortable.</p>
		<p>In response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax provisions for individuals and businesses, the IRS mandated that all Applicable Large Employers (ALEs) report offers of health coverage and enrollment information to their employees (and the IRS) for the 2015 calendar year. The 1095-C form is submitted to full-time employees to determine their eligibility for a premium tax credit while the 1094-C and 1095-C forms are submitted to the IRS to determine if the employer owes money for abiding by the shared responsibility portion of section 4980H provision.</p>
		<p>So the Boss assigned us a project: a hefty project with big penalties. Report incorrectly and our business could lose a ton of cash and our employees could be screwed come tax season 2016. The hiccup: how the hell were supposed to compile, organize, sift, and code this data? The only instructions given were presented in a vague legalese. Like the demonic university professor that gets off on torturing students with fun, fluffy lectures and then hellish exams taken from texts that were never assigned.</p>
		<p>It quickly became evident that this would be an organization-wide project involving legal counsel, several information systems, payroll, finance, and communications to name a few. Gathering hours worked to determine full-time status from multiple tracking platforms proved a challenge and even exposed fundamental flaws in work time calculations (supplemental, comp, vacation) in organizationally accepted systems. Other operational weak points like payroll turnaround and employee records were uncovered.</p>
		<p>In an effort to minimize the number of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets from different departments, I taught myself Microsoft SQL basics to handle searches, filters, and outputs for over 10,000 employees. There was no way we could stay organized and streamlined while drowning in spreadsheets.</p>
		<p>Vendor software and service level agreements were chewed over and contested.  Our Human Resource Information System (HRIS) vendor hustled to provide the level of data necessary to accurately report coverage levels throughout 2015 and create business unique functions to fulfill our needs. The HRIS offered services through a third-party Health Care Reform consulting company. We anticipated that our final product would receive a ‘stamp of approval’ from an outside source before successfully submitting data to the IRS (hopefully avoiding having to shoot ourselves in the foot) after our data set was put through the paces in an intelligent verification program. Oh how naive! The HCR consultants were less educated on IRS requirements than their clients and the rigorous verification of data was a basic Adobe PDF import and create function that certified forms with erroneous codes and missing data. </p>
		<p>Needless to say, in the end, our department identified, coded, and generated 1095-C forms for over 6,000 employees without the guidance of the HCR consultant. I cringe to think of how much dough the HRIS vendor forked over for the service. Luckily enough time has passed that it is now a running joke: not a gash in the leg.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, during neck breaking data mining, analysis, processing, and coding, the Boss changed the rules and offered additional explanations. With each IRS edit, our team analyzed the same data through an additional lens. Like switching from blue tinted glassed to green and then purple. Although frustrating, the Boss kept us on our toes and forced us to view one data set from multiple angles. Imaging the IRS fumbling as well in its own task gave us warm and fuzzies: especially when they pushed the deadlines back by three months and (at the time of this post) are still unable to electronically accept fillings through their Affordable Care Act Information Returns (AIR) Program.</p>
		<p>Since we gave up on the HCR consultant, our team researched and sourced 1095-C forms and programmed existing finance software to print and mail thousands of forms to employees by the March 31st deadline. It turns out that the press and seal form business is booming.</p>
		<p>In a normal environment, the end product is submitted to the manager and feedback is received in a matter of days or even weeks. The important thing to note is that feedback will be delivered. With the IRS, no constructive response is required or even expected. They don’t send us certified mail if we submitted A+ 1095-C forms. And the probability that our business will be audited and fined is extremely low. If by some strange event our data is reviewed and fined by the IRS, we won’t be contacted until 2017 or 2018. </p>
		<p>Easing into 2016, I know that my Boss is going nowhere. He likes his position and intends to make a career here. The Boss brought his tacky landscape artwork from home and hung it up in his office. He is here to stay. Now, at least we all know his a difficult pill: arrogant, condescending, and aloof. He does not have clear expectations and he is always changing his mind. I know he is difficult and I understand why no one likes him but at least I know how to manage him in 2016. </p>
