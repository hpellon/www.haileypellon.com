              <h1>Workaholics</h1>
		
            </div>
		<blockquote>“Workaholics aren't heroes. They don't save the day, they just use it up. The real hero is home because she figured out a faster way.” 
-Jason Fried, Rework</blockquote>
		<p>Amen Mr. Fried. </p>
		<p>Reading Rework (ok… I listened to the audiobook while walking the dog) got me thinking. The book by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals finally put into words what my partner and I mean to say when discussing the toxicity of Workaholics. </p>
		<p>It seems that the folks staying late at the office aren't getting much accomplished. They certainly aren’t the heroes they pretend to be. Workaholics actually create more work for everyone else on the team while burning needless energy. The more time they spend pouring over data late into the evening, the more likely they will find small inconsistencies of little importance. Those little findings create more and more work for the surrounding the workforce.</p>
		<p>The next morning’s meeting, when presenting their findings like Mensa scholars, not only do the Workaholics take the opportunity to point out their own natural intelligence but also how many hours they hovered over the computer alone by candlelight. Like each additional hour worked overnight makes them an even greater super hero.
</p>
		<p>The Workaholic behavior by a few creates a larger company culture that puts pressure on all employees to increase 'ass in the seat' time: staying at work later to satisfy a time quota leading to reduced productivity throughout the workday and eventual burnout. Those sitting to just satisfy time aren’t working. They are spending their time on Facebook or surfing the internet. Sure one poor soul is working to finish a project but the rest are online shopping until 6 pm rolls around and it is socially acceptable to leave. They would all rather be home making dinner for their families and singing the babies to sleep. So they sit disgruntled and let the animosity towards their coworkers or employer build.</p>
		<p>Yes, working overtime is necessary and sometimes crucial when you are under the gun for a deadline or unforeseen events occur. Working overtime every day? No way. </p>
		<p>There is no sense in working overtime consistently for 40 years with dreams of someday calling it quits. The new workforce will most likely never be able retire so they must find a livable work/life balance. We must learn to work smarter not longer. We must start utilizing new software and applications so we can get more work done during a standard work day and start living the remaining hours. </p>
		<p>To maintain healthy and engaged staff, we must move away from the culture that glorifies Workaholics and towards one that fosters a life of balance. We need to start recognizing that those who clock out on time as our most efficient, smart employees. </p>
